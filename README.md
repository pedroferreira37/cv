# Online Resume Web Application

This repository contains the code for an online resume web application. The application was developed as a side project with the aim of creating a platform to build and showcase resumes in an easy and convenient manner.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project stemmed from a personal experience. The need to create a resume for a family member led to the exploration of various web applications available. However, frustration arose when encountering paid services without prior notification. This prompted the decision to develop a self-built solution that would address the issue.

## Key Learnings
Throughout the development process, several valuable insights were gained. Here are some of the notable takeaways:

Embrace the use of neovim/vim as an efficient text editor.
Plan, design, and select tools, but remain flexible and adaptable to pivot as the problem unfolds. Iteratively create and recreate until a concrete understanding of the problem is achieved.
While writing good code is essential, it is more important to have functional code that can be improved upon. Don't be deterred by initial lack of knowledge in implementing the best approach. Start building, and as you progress, seek out the optimal solutions.
Even your side project can become tedious at times, but perseverance is key to pushing through the challenges.
Insights on Code Implementation
The project involved handling numerous user inputs, providing valuable insights into various approaches. Additionally, the concept of "save on change" was explored as the application required saving user data whenever modifications were made.

The development was done using Next.js with the experimental app dir feature. While some aspects of the framework were not favored, such as server warmup time and potential organizational issues arising from endpoint creation based on folder naming, they served as learning experiences.

Dealing with PDFs proved to be a complex task, presenting its own set of challenges and intricacies.

## Deployment and Stack
The project is scheduled for deployment this weak. The following stack was utilized in its development:

Next.js with TypeScript (NextTS) and NextAuth for authentication
Tailwind CSS for styling
Prisma as the database toolkit
MySQL as the database management system

Additional Note

>To bring about change in the world, it is crucial to begin by changing oneself. Embarcing on personal growth and transformation is an essential first step towards making a meaningful impact.
